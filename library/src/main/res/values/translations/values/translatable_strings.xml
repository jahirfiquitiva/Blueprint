    <string-array name="answers">
        <item>You need a launcher with Icon Pack support.
            Check the Google Play Store description for supported launchers.
            If you are not sure which launcher should you use, just go to \"Apply\" section, then
            choose one from the list.
        </item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Apply\" section, or go back to main section of the app, then tap the Floating Action Button.
            Choose the launcher you want to apply the icons to.
            If your launcher is not listed there, but this icon pack is compatible with it
            (see on Google Play Store description for the list of supported launchers),
            you can apply it manually from launcher settings.
        </item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Icons\" section, or go back to main section of the app, then tap the button that says \"Icons\".</item>
