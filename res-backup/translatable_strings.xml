    <string-array name="answers">
        <item>You need a launcher with Icon Pack support.
            Check the Google Play Store description for supported launchers.
            If you are not sure which launcher should you use, just go to \"Apply\" section, then
            choose one from the list.
        </item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Apply\" section, or go back to main section of the app, then tap the Floating Action Button.
            Choose the launcher you want to apply the icons to.
            If your launcher is not listed there, but this icon pack is compatible with it
            (see on Google Play Store description for the list of supported launchers),
            you can apply it manually from launcher settings.
        </item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Icons\" section, or go back to main section of the app, then tap the button that says \"Icons\".</item>
        <item>It depends on the launcher you are using. Not every launcher support icon editing.
            But, in most of them, you can edit the icon by long-pressing it or doing a double tap.
        </item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Requests\" section.
        </item>
        <item>It happened because the icon pack was moved to SD Card, you should install it in
            internal storage.
        </item>
        <item>The problem might come with the launcher you are using, when handling big resolution.
            You can fix it by increasing icon size to 115 - 120%.
            Or try using another launcher.
        </item>
        <item>Send an icon request.</item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Settings\" section.
            Then check the \"Hide icon from launcher\" option.
        </item>
        <item>Go to your home screen, then create a widget for the app which name is \"IconRestorer\".</item>
        <item>Slide the NavigationDrawer from the left, and go to \"Settings\" section.
            Then uncheck the \"Hide icon from launcher\" option.
